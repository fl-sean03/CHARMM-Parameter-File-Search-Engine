+nice, it works, lets implement another column with the line number which should already be saved in the csv files with column name "Line Number". then when clicked, there will be a split screen where the left side if the same and the rightside popus up a view of the parameter file, already scrolled to that line. 

# 2025-01-24 08:41:16.682523
+n

# 2025-01-24 08:42:10.649887
+lets improve the aesthetics of the nonsplit and split view further add some things like line count on the file rendering and overall increase aesthetics

+n

# 2025-01-24 08:44:43.489762

+n

# 2025-01-24 08:48:33.051683
+make the column titles for the list view smaller and make them sticky as you scroll, remove the copy all button in the text view, make the text view buttons smaller as well. also in the list view when you select an element to scroll to it in the text view, that line in the list view should also be highlighted so we know which one we just clicked 

# 2025-01-24 08:51:28.978531
+we can remove the line number column as well

# 2025-01-24 08:52:26.142033
+we make make the column names under list view sticky as you scroll through the list

# 2025-01-24 08:54:07.816942
+in list view they are still not sticky as i scroll, i am referring to these column names:<<<
+Force Field Type	Mass	Comments>> and the columns for the others as well

# 2025-01-24 08:56:03.829343
+for the buttons in text view when you hove over it should say something like close or whatnot just to knnow wheat they do, also add a button that takes you back to the highlighted line

# 2025-01-24 08:56:51.793621
+add some padding on the rightside the tooltips are being cut off

# 2025-01-24 08:58:45.131838
+between the split views lets have an adjustable slider so you cna adjust how much space each view takes up

# 2025-01-24 09:00:14.340559
+should only activate if the text view is open, if not then the list view will take up the whole space

# 2025-01-24 09:01:58.559318
+seems like splitter does not exist when i load in the text view

# 2025-01-24 09:03:06.176851
+still not seeing the splitter, or its not where its supposed to be

# 2025-01-24 09:04:11.786555
+still not there make sure we can clearly see and highlight it, make it vibrant yellow so we can see it at a glance then we will change it after, 

# 2025-01-24 09:07:51.541104
+okay im not seeing it at all, so just remove it and its functionality entirely, kust make sure our parameter data and source file views fill up the entire space given without any additioal white space on the sides

+remove padding from left of parameter data and right of split file view remove as much as possible theres a lot of empty/white/blank space here

# 2025-01-24 09:12:50.143857
+now add a little bit of padding to the left and right and a little to the top as well

# 2025-01-24 09:13:21.233395
+theres still some bottom padding we can remove

# 2025-01-24 09:14:16.953539
+lets improve the top bar with some more aesthetics instead of just a blank top bar.

# 2025-01-24 09:15:20.684787
+there should be no overall scroll bar only the scroll bars for the individual views and the ability to scroll the parameter files if you have enough files

# 2025-01-24 09:16:20.550168
+we can make the top boar less tall about half as tall

# 2025-01-24 09:20:32.475259
+now for the search bar looking back at that functionality there may be times when we need to look up combinations of atoms types for example dihedrals have 4 atoms per entry, i need to find all that include at least 1 NH2 and one CT1, in the search bar i will enter something like "NH2 CT1" or "CT1 NH2" or i will put commas to seperate them, what i want is to allow for this functionality, make it general enogh to so people have different ways of searching can still get a good output

# 2025-01-24 09:25:00.396669
+in the table view lets make sure that :<<<
+Force Field Type	Mass	Comments>>> column headers are floating/sticky as we scroll, essentially they stay visible in the correct positions as we scroll,

# 2025-01-24 09:26:00.611250
+not actually woeking it looks like the table is contained within the parameter data element right? so we might need to make it so we only scroll within the table

# 2025-01-24 09:27:00.863790
+alright so this is better however the table size is not filling to the space it can, it looks like it stops halfway

# 2025-01-24 09:28:45.484529
+table view layout is still not fully optimized, when the text view is gone, it should take up the full space, when the text view is shown then it should squish to adjust 

# 2025-01-24 09:29:42.599485
+the table element itself seems to just be blank after "Comments" column its just a blank space, can we make sure it expands to fill the full space 

# 2025-01-24 09:30:55.940325
+even better how about we just end the table element where it ends after comments so that we don't see all that white space

# 2025-01-24 09:31:44.072284
+looks like the scroll functionality for the table is gone, please add it back

# 2025-01-24 09:32:18.699014
+when the scroll was added back in, the white/blank space also came back

# 2025-01-24 09:33:21.159259
+getting better, now the sticky headers seems to not be positioned correclty, they are too bunched up and don;t align with their data

# 2025-01-24 09:34:00.461213
+still not aligned properly just get rid of the sticky header functionality alltogether
