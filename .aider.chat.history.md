#### added images as png files can we add them to the README so they show up properly  

I'll help add the screenshots to the README.md file. I'll add them in a new section after the key features to showcase the interface.

README.md

## Key Features

### Interface Screenshots

#### Initial Upload Screen
![Initial Upload Screen](imgs/Initial_Upload.png)

#### Search Interface
![Search Interface](imgs/Search_Engine.png)

### File Management
>>>>>>> REPLACE
</source>

This will add the screenshots with descriptive captions in a new section right after the Key Features introduction. The images will be displayed in order showing the workflow from initial upload to search interface.

The relative paths used (imgs/Initial_Upload.png and imgs/Search_Engine.png) will work as long as the images are stored in an "imgs" directory at the root of your repository.
